# Software Evolution Lab (EVOL)
The Software Evolution Lab is home to graduate researchers in advancing empiricial software engineering research at [UNLV](). The `EVOL Research Group` is headed by [Prof. John Businge](https://johnxu21.github.io/). 

## EVOL Research Group
The current research interests are in the areas of code recommenders. This includes searching for code snippets (bug/vulnerability fix, refactoring, test cases, optimizations, e.t.c) and recommending them. As a next step after the snippet search, We want to help the developer with the integration of the snippet. However, we can also be a little flexible. If you have a related software engineering topic that sounds interesting to me, feel free to email us with specifics.

## Repostories
1. [RefMergeCommits](https://github.com/unlv-evol/RefMergeCommits) - It analyzes merge commits in git repositories and determines changes and merge conflicts caused by refactoring operations
2. [PatchIntegrator](https://github.com/unlv-evol/PatchIntegrator) - A good first look at patch integration from source to target variant in divergent fork
